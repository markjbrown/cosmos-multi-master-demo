# Cosmos DB Multi-Master Demo

This demo demonstrates the difference in write latency between a single-master and multi-master enabled accounts in Cosmos DB. It also demonstrates how conflict resolution works for Last-Writer-Wins and also how conflicts are written the the Conflicts Feed for deferred resolution by an application.
